                                We work closely with our suppliers to help implement industry-leading concepts for carbon minimization. Our goal is to support farmers and producers who participate in regenerative practicesâ€”ones that give more to the land than they take away.

                                We calculate an accurate carbon footprint for each of our menu items by commissioning carbon assessments of our specific suppliers. These reports illustrate how much carbon is generated at every stage of business, from seed to salad. We use this data to direct our menu and adjust as needed.

                                We optimize our building materials from construction to furniture, investing in clean energy, and industrial equipment to make a minimal impact.
